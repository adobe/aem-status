    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <p>
        On October 20, 2025 at 07:07 UTC, we detected error messages in our monitoring system
        related to an underlying AWS outage in the US-EAST-1 region. AWS reported increased error
        rates and latencies affecting multiple services, with the root cause identified as DNS
        resolution issues with the DynamoDB API endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        The incident initially impacted AEM publishing operations. At 07:20 UTC, we began observing
        a low level of delivery errors, totaling approximately 200 errors. Our delivery infrastructure
        operates as a dual-stack system across multiple regions, which allowed our team to quickly
        switch to the secondary stack at 07:25 UTC, eliminating delivery disruptions while continuing
        to investigate the publishing impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the time of the incident, publishing was operating on a single-stack, single-region
        configuration. At 09:03 UTC, our team successfully brought up a secondary region for AEM
        publishing, restoring full publishing functionality even as the AWS incident continued.
        By 12:06 UTC, we began restoring the original service configuration while closely monitoring
        the situation. Normal operations were fully restored at 12:14 UTC, with a total incident
        duration of 5 hours and 7 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rapid mitigation demonstrated the effectiveness of our dual-stack delivery architecture
        for immediate failover, and our team's ability to rapidly provision and deploy additional
        infrastructure capacity for publishing during an active incident. This allowed us to maintain
        service continuity despite the severity of the underlying AWS infrastructure issue that
        affected numerous major platforms globally.
