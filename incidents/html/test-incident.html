    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <p>
        On 10.07.2025 18:25 UTC we received alerts that Operational Telemetry script delivery was failing.
    </p>
    <p>
        This turned out to be a false positive, and no actual script delivery failures were observed.
    </p>
    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>Nothing happened. Phew!</p>

    <h3>Impact Analysis</h3>
    <p>No customers or projects were impacted</p>

    <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Our monitoring for Operational Telemetry confirms that the scripts delivered by Operational Telemetry
        have checksums matching the published checksums on GitHub releases. This check uses the GitHub API
        to retrieve recent releases and release artifacts.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the GitHub API is not available, or the worker running the check is rate limited, the check will fail.
        This has been causing the alert and our team was notified.
    </p>
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
        As this is a very infrequent occurrence and the cost of a false negative exceeds the cost of a false positive
        alert, no changes to the monitoring configuration will be made.
