    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        On November 18, 2025, between 11:30 UTC and 11:43 UTC, a global Cloudflare outage impacted our
        delivery services with an overall error rate of 0.927%. Our team detected the issue within
        minutes through automated monitoring and initiated failover to the alternate stack within 11 minutes. The delivery
        service experienced minimal impact and was fully restored by 11:43 UTC.
    </p>
    <p>
        The root cause was a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/">global outage at Cloudflare</a>,
        lasting from 11:20 UTC to 17:06 UTC.
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact on the delivery service was noticeable at an overall error rate of 0.927%,
        from 11:30 UTC to 11:43 UTC. Customer sites were impacted with a slighty elevated error rate for 13 minutes.
        Customers who had project-specific Cloudflare dependencies were more severely impacted. This includes
        usage of Early Access features hosted by Adobe, or self-hosted Cloudflare Workers.

    <h2>What went well</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated monitoring detected the issue within minutes</li>
      <li>Failover to alernate stack was executed within 11 minutes</li>
      <li>Multi-cloud strategy limited customer impact</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Action items</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In case of a future Cloudflare outage, for customer sites using Cloudflare, switch to the healthy stack at the DNS level immediately upon detection
        (target: within 5 minutes of confirmed outage)
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve runbook to provide clearer steps for managing a global Cloudflare outage, including decision tree for
        DNS-level failover
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidate logs from all relevant technical services to help the on-call engineer with an overview during an
        outage, as well as facilitate the RCA
      </li>

      <h2>resolved</h2>
      <p>At 11:48 UTC, Cloudflare confirmed a global networking issue on their infrastructure.</p>
      <p>
        Since 11:43 UTC, delivery has been fully restored via failover to the alternate delivery stack.
        While the Cloudflare issue continues, our customers are no longer impacted. We will monitor
        the situation and plan to switch back to Cloudflare once their infrastructure is confirmed stable.
