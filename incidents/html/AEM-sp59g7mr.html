    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        On November 18, 2025, between 11:30 UTC and 14:40 UTC, a global Cloudflare outage impacted our
        delivery services with an overall error rate of 0.08%. Our team detected the issue within
        minutes through automated monitoring and initiated failover to AWS within 11 minutes. The delivery
        service experienced minimal impact and was fully restored by 14:40 UTC.
    </p>
    <p>
        The root cause was a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/">global outage at Cloudflare</a>,
        lasting from 11:20 UTC to 17:06 UTC.
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact on the delivery service was barely noticeable at an overall error rate of 0.08%,
        from 11:30 UTC to 14:40 UTC. The vast majority of projects were only impacted for
        12 minutes until 11:42 UTC, and less than 1% of projects experienced elevated
        errors until 14:40 UTC.

    <h2>Action items</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In case of a future Cloudflare outage, we always need to switch to the healthy stack at the DNS level from the beginning
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve runbook to provide clearer steps and better help us manage a global Cloudflare outage
      </li>
      <li>
        Clearly define all technical services that belong to the delivery and publishing business service SLOs
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidate logs from all relevant technical services to help the on-call engineer with an overview during an outage, as well as facilitate the RCA
      </li>

      <h2>resolved</h2>
      <p>
        At 14:40 UTC, delivery has been fully restored via failover to Fastly and AWS infrastructure.
