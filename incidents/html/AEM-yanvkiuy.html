    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        On October 20, 2025, between 06:54 and 08:44 UTC, an AWS US-EAST-1 region outage 
        affecting Lambda and SQS services caused publishing disruptions for all AEM customers 
        and minimal delivery errors. Our team deployed a secondary publishing region within 
        110 minutes, restoring full functionality while the AWS incident was ongoing.
    </p>
    <h3>Incident Overview</h3>
    <p>
        On October 20, 2025 at 06:54 UTC, we detected the first error messages in our monitoring system
        related to an underlying AWS outage in the US-EAST-1 region. The outage primarily affected
        AWS Lambda and SQS services, causing disruptions to dependent services including AEM.
    </p>
    <p>
        At 07:05 UTC, we observed publishing disruptions caused by the AWS outage, affecting all
        customers' publishing workflows. At 07:20 UTC, we began observing a low level of delivery
        errors, totaling 200 requests with minimal customer impact. Our delivery infrastructure
        operates as a dual-stack system across multiple regions, which allowed our team to quickly
        switch to the secondary stack at 07:25 UTC, eliminating delivery disruptions while continuing
        to investigate the publishing impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the time of the incident, publishing was operating on a single-stack, single-region
        configuration. Given the uncertain resolution timeline from AWS and the availability of our
        engineering team, we made the decision to bring up a secondary region rather than wait for
        the AWS recovery. At 09:03 UTC, approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes after identifying the
        publishing impact, our team successfully deployed a secondary publishing region, restoring
        full functionality for all customers even as the AWS incident continued.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the 110-minute incident, the overall error rate across all publishing service requests
        was 8.33%. However, impact varied significantly by sub-service, with Admin API delivering
        errors for 72% of requests, while *.aem.page only delivered 0.025% errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some customers contacted support regarding publishing disruptions, but by that time, the impact
        and status had already been communicated through our status page. At 12:06 UTC, we began
        restoring the original service configuration while closely monitoring the situation. Normal
        operations were fully restored at 12:14 UTC, with a total incident duration of 5 hours and 7 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rapid mitigation demonstrated the effectiveness of our dual-stack delivery architecture
        for immediate failover, and our team's ability to rapidly provision and deploy additional
        infrastructure capacity during an active incident. This experience reinforces the value of
        multi-region architectures and having the right team available during critical incidents.
