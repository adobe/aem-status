    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        On October 20, 2025, during a broader AWS US-EAST-1 region outage that affected multiple
        Adobe Experience Manager services, the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations experienced a
        service disruption. While the underlying service issue was resolved within hours, the
        official status page at status.adobe.com was not updated to reflect the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations impact.
        The status site at <a href="https://www.aemstatus.net/details.html?incident=AEM-yanvkiuy">aemstatus.net</a>
        correctly reflected the incident in real-time, demonstrating that our monitoring and automated incident reporting
        was functioning properly. However, customers relying on the official Adobe status page experienced a communication gap. This
        resulted in customer confusion and an escalation from a major customer who
        was unable to confirm service status through official channels. The official status page was
        corrected 4 days after the incident, on October 24, 2025.
    </p>
    <h3>Impact Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Service Impact:</strong> The API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations experienced disruptions
        during the AWS outage window (07:05 - 08:44 UTC on October 20, 2025), consistent with
        the broader impact to AEM publishing services. While the underlying technical issue was
        resolved within the incident window, customers lacked visibility into the status through
        official channels.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Communication Impact:</strong> For 4 days (October 20-24, 2025), the official Adobe
        status page at status.adobe.com did not accurately reflect that API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations had been impacted.
        Customers checking status.adobe.com would not have seen acknowledgment of the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations
        disruption during the October 20th incident. In contrast,
        <a href="https://www.aemstatus.net/">aemstatus.net</a> correctly displayed the incident status throughout,
        highlighting that the failure was specific to the official status page communication pipeline rather than
        our monitoring capabilities. This communication gap on the official channel led to at least one customer escalation and
        undermined trust in our official status communication channels.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Customer Impact:</strong> Customers using API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations experienced
        the same publishing disruptions as other AEM services during the AWS outage (8.33% overall
        error rate, with Admin API experiencing 72% errors). The lack of status page updates
        prevented customers from distinguishing between localized issues and platform-wide incidents,
        increasing support burden and customer frustration.
    </p>
    <h3>Detection</h3>
    <p>
        The underlying service disruption was detected through our standard monitoring at 06:54 UTC
        on October 20, 2025, and was correctly published to <a href="https://www.aemstatus.net/details.html?incident=AEM-yanvkiuy">aemstatus.net</a>
        in real-time. However, the failure to update the official status page at status.adobe.com went undetected by
        our systems. The issue was discovered 4 days later when the AEM Service Manager was notified
        by the engineering team that the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations impact had not been reflected on the official status page
        during the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
        The delayed detection highlights a gap in our status communication verification processes—we
        had no automated checks to ensure all affected services were properly reflected on
        status.adobe.com, and no manual review process caught the omission during or immediately
        after the incident. The fact that aemstatus.net displayed correct information demonstrates
        that our automated monitoring and incident detection systems were functioning as designed, but
        the manual process for updating the official status page failed.

    <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
    <h4>Trigger</h4>
    <p>
        The immediate trigger was the high-volume, high-stress nature of the AWS US-EAST-1 outage
        on October 20, 2025. With more than 100 services reporting impact through a single Slack
        thread, the manual intake process for updating status.adobe.com became overwhelmed, and
        the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations impact report was not processed.
    </p>
    <h4>Root Cause</h4>
    <p>
        Using the "Five Whys" technique to dig deeper into the systematic failures:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Why was the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations not added to status.adobe.com?</strong><br>
            The manual intake process that relies on monitoring Slack channels missed the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations
            update among 100+ concurrent messages during the AWS outage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Why does status page updating rely on manual monitoring of Slack channels?</strong><br>
            Not all AEM services are configured with auto-launch capabilities to automatically create
            and update Customer Service Organization (CSO) records when monitoring detects issues.
            Services without auto-launch require manual intervention to be added to the status page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Why doesn't API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations have auto-launch configured?</strong><br>
            The integration between the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations monitoring (which functions
            reliably, as evidenced by aemstatus.net's accurate real-time reporting) and Adobe's corporate
            status page infrastructure has been assessed as producing false positives. Rather than improving
            the integration layer or the corporate status tooling, the decision was made to disable auto-launch
            entirely, creating a dependency on manual processes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Why is there no fallback mechanism when manual intake fails?</strong><br>
            The status update process was designed with the assumption that manual intake would scale
            adequately. There were no automated verification checks to ensure all reported impacts
            were reflected on status.adobe.com, and no systematic post-incident review to validate
            status page completeness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Why was there no detection that status.adobe.com was incomplete for 4 days?</strong><br>
            We lacked monitoring and alerting for status page accuracy. There was no system to verify
            that services experiencing known impacts were properly reflected on the status page, and
            no automated reconciliation between incident records and published status updates.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Systemic Issues Identified</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single point of failure:</strong> Status updates depend entirely on a manual process with no automated failsafes</li>
        <li><strong>Design doesn't handle scale:</strong> Manual intake works for small incidents but breaks down during platform-wide outages</li>
        <li><strong>False dichotomy in monitoring:</strong> Treating auto-launch as binary (on/off) rather than exploring graduated responses or context-aware automation</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of verification loops:</strong> No post-incident review process to ensure status page accuracy</li>
        <li><strong>Insufficient ownership clarity:</strong> Service teams cannot directly update status, creating dependency on centralized team during high-stress incidents</li>
        <li><strong>Missing observability:</strong> No monitoring of the status communication system itself</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Immediate Fix:</strong> On October 24, 2025, when notified of the missing status
        update, the Service Manager manually added the API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations to the October 20th Customer Service
        Organization (CSO) record, correcting the historical status page to accurately reflect the
        impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Short-term Improvements:</strong> As of November 1, 2025, the Customer Response
        Center (CRC) implemented strengthened intake protocols and updated runbooks for handling
        high-volume incident scenarios. These improvements include better tagging of impacted
        services and structured checklists for large-scale outages.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Long-term Prevention:</strong> A meeting will be scheduled with relevant parties to re-assess the
        feasibility of implementing automated status updates for API for Edge Delivery Services and Integrations,
        exploring options to better integrate the service's existing reliable monitoring with Adobe's
        corporate status page infrastructure.
