<h1 class="none">Delivery service disrupted by Cloudflare R2 outage</h1>

    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        On February 7, 2026 between 01:57 (UTC) and 02:34 (UTC), delivery service requests experienced elevated error
        rates of approximately 0.035% due to an outage in Cloudflare's R2 storage service. Our automated monitoring
        detected the issue at 02:05 UTC (8 minutes after onset), and we initiated a manual failover to an alternate
        cloud provider, restoring the service by 02:34 UTC (29 minutes after onset).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the failover introduced a secondary issue: customers with very large content indexes encountered 
        413 (Request Entity Too Large) errors on the alternate provider. This continued until we migrated affected
        projects back to Cloudflare backends on February 9, 2026 at 16:30 UTC, after confirming the underlying R2
        issue was resolved. The total incident duration was 62 hours and 38 minutes, though the primary outage lasted
        only 37 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Root Cause</h3>
    <p>
        The immediate cause was an <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/qy92kxdhg16t">underlying issue 
        with Cloudflare's R2 service</a> that began at approximately 01:57 UTC on February 7, 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the extended impact to customers (through February 9) revealed architectural limitations in our
        multi-cloud strategy. Our alternate cloud provider had lower payload size limits, resulting in 
        413 (Request Entity Too Large) errors for customers with large indexes. This indicates our failover strategy
        did not account for provider-specific constraints, and we lacked feature parity testing across backup 
        infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Immediate Mitigation (02:33 UTC):</strong> We switched projects using Cloudflare backends to an
        alternate cloud provider, restoring delivery service functionality. However, this introduced a new issue where
        customers with very large indexes began experiencing 413 (Request Entity Too Large) responses due to lower
        payload limits on the alternate provider.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Permanent Resolution (February 9, 16:30 UTC):</strong> After Cloudflare resolved the underlying R2
        issue at 04:43 UTC on February 7, we monitored the situation for stability. Once confirmed stable, we migrated
        affected projects back to Cloudflare backends on February 9 at 16:30 UTC, fully resolving the 413 errors for
        customers with large indexes.
    </p>

    <h3>Action Items</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Evaluate options to improve index storage and processing format to reduce payload sizes and increase
            resilience to provider constraints
        </li>
    </ul>
