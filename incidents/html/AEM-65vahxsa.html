    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        On February 7, 2026 between 01:57 (UTC) and 02:34 (UTC), we observed an increase of errors on requests served from Cloudflare backends.
        As a result the delivery service was impacted with a error rate of ~0.035%.
        Our team detected the issue within 35 minutes through automated monitoring and initiated failover to the alternate stack within 2 minutes.
        The delivery service was restored by 02:34 UTC.
        Some customers experienced an increase of 413 responses after that until we switched them back to Cloudflare backends at Feburary 9, 2026 16:30 (UTC).
    </p>

    <h3>Root Cause</h3>
    <p>
        An underlying issue with <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/qy92kxdhg16t">Cloudflare's R2 service</a> caused the increase of errors.
    </p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        The issue was resolved by switching projects using Cloudflare backends to another cloud provider at 02:33 UTC.
        After the resoluiton of the underlying issue at 04:43 UTC, we switched the affected projects back to Cloudflare backends on Feburary 9, 2026 16:30 (UTC).
        In that time frame some customers experienced an increase of 413 responses for very large indexes.
