    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <p>
        On 09.09.2025 18:35 UTC we noticed a slight increase (&lt;0.1%) in Edge Delivery Service errors.
        Upon investigation, we found that one of our suppliers had already opened a major incident related
        to worker delivery, confirmed status, and implemented a fix within 30 minutes. There were no
        reports of customer impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vendor's fix was deployed by 09.09.2025 19:02 UTC.
