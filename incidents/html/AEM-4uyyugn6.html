  <p>
    On December 5, 2025, at 08:56 UTC, we were alerted to a service disruption by one of our
    customer-specific site alerts. The incident lasted 24 minutes and affected a fraction of our
    customers who experienced delivery failures with 500 errors from Cloudflare's infrastructure.
    <br>
    The incident was isolated to customer-selected Cloudflare services and did not impact our core
    delivery infrastructure. AEM infrastructure was not impacted by this incident and remained
    operational.
    <br>
    Our internally facing 3rd party operations infrastructure (logging), was also temporarily
    inaccessible.
    <br>
    Normal service resumed at 09:20 UTC following Cloudflare's resolution of the outage. Our
    operations team successfully switched to our backup log monitoring solution, maintaining
    operational visibility throughout the incident.
  </p>

  <h3>Root Cause</h3>
  <p>
    The incident was caused by an outage in the
    <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/lfrm31y6sw9q">Cloudflare network</a>, a
    3rd-party service chosen by the impacted customers. Cloudflare reported that a change made to
    how their Web Application Firewall parses requests caused their network to become temporarily
    unavailable. This was an internal change by the 3rd-party provider and not a security attack.

      Post-Mortem</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Detection</h3>
  <p>
    The incident was detected at 08:56 UTC through customer-specific site alerts. No other alerts
    were triggered. AEM delivery infrastructure remained operational. The simultaneous loss of
    access to internally facing 3rd party operations infrastructure created a secondary operational
    challenge that was immediately apparent to the operations team.
  </p>

  <h3>Resolution</h3>
  <p>
    The underlying network issue was resolved by the 3rd-party provider (Cloudflare) implementing a
    fix for the faulty WAF change. Upon discovering the inaccessibility of Coralogix, the
    operations team successfully switched all internal log monitoring and analysis to our
    designated backup logging solution. This ensured continuous operational visibility despite the
    primary tool failure. No action is required by customers as the external service is fully
    functional by 09:20 UTC.
  </p>

  <h3>Action Items</h3>
  <p>
    The incident highlights dependencies on critical 3rd-party infrastructure for both customer
    delivery and internal operations.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Dependency Mapping Review: Explicitly review critical internal operational tools (e.g.,
      Coralogix, monitoring) to understand the full blast radius of external outages
    </li>
    <li>
      Document Log Monitoring Failover: Formalize the runbook for switching to the backup log
      monitoring solution (used successfully in this incident)
    </li>

    <h2>Resolved</h2>
    <p>
      This incident has been resolved. The 3rd-party service has restored their network
      availability, and both impacted customer sites and our internal Coralogix logging service
      are operating normally. Log analysis has been switched back to the primary Coralogix
      platform.

  <li>
    <h2>Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      The 3rd-party provider has implemented a fix and is currently monitoring the results. Our
      customer sites are showing restored service delivery, and the Coralogix service is
      accessible again. We are continuing to monitor the incident.

  <li>
    <h2>Identified</h2>
    <p>
      We have identified that the issue is due to a major incident with a 3rd-party network
      provider (Cloudflare) impacting selected customers who use their WAF service. Furthermore,
      our internal logging tool, Coralogix, is also inaccessible due to this outage. Our core
      customer-facing services are unaffected, and the Operations Team has switched to the backup
      log monitoring solution.
