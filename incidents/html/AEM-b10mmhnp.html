<h1 class="minor">Cloudflare Outage with Minor Impact on Authoring and Publishing</h1>
<article data-incident-start-time="2025-11-18T11:30:00.000Z" data-incident-end-time="2025-11-18T11:43:00.000Z" data-incident-error-rate="0.02794" data-incident-impacted-service="publishing">
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        On November 18, 2025, between 11:30 UTC and 11:43 UTC, a global Cloudflare outage impacted our
        publishing services with a weighted average error rate of 2.794%. Our team detected the issue within
        minutes through automated monitoring and initiated failover to AWS within 11 minutes. The
        publishing service was fully restored by 11:43 UTC. No data loss occurred, and the vast majority of
        customers experienced either no impact or brief interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The root cause was a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/">global outage at Cloudflare</a>
        lasting from 11:20 UTC to 17:06 UTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Admin API was not impacted by the outage: Updating and publishing content remained
      available throughout the incident. Customers would run into occasional errors while previewing
      content on <code>aem.page</code> domains, especially during the first few minutes of the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the Authoring and Publishing SLO, but related, <code>da.live</code> was impacted severely at a 4.1% error rate for a longer duration, between 11:30 UTC and 15:30 UTC.
      Viewing, updating and publishing remained challenging for most customers throughout the incident.

    <h2>What went well</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated monitoring detected the issue within minutes</li>
      <li>Failover to alternate stack was executed within 11 minutes</li>
      <li>Multi-cloud strategy limited customer impact</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Action items</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In case of a future Cloudflare outage, for customer sites using Cloudflare, switch to the healthy stack at the DNS level
        immediately upon detection (target: within 5 minutes of confirmed outage)
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve runbook to provide clearer steps for managing a global Cloudflare outage, including decision tree for DNS-level failover
      </li>
      <li>
        Clearly define all technical services that belong to the publishing business service SLO, including <code>*.aem.reviews</code> and <code>*.da.live</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidate logs from all relevant technical services to help the on-call engineer with an overview during an outage, as well as facilitate the RCA
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve monitoring to alert on elevated error rates on <code>*.da.live</code> and <code>*.aem.reviews</code> services
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow for DNS-level switch on <code>admin.hlx.page</code> and <code>da.live</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>

      <h2>investigating</h2>
      <p>At 11:31 UTC, our monitors alerted us about errors from Cloudflare workers.</p>
      <time>2025-11-18T11:31:33.836Z</time>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>monitoring</h2>
      <p>At 11:42 UTC, we switched our backends to AWS. In the 11 minutes that passed since our monitor alerted us,
        we observed elevated error rates on publishing (*.page).</p>
      <time>2025-11-18T11:42:43.461Z</time>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>resolved</h2>
      <p>At 11:48 UTC, Cloudflare confirmed a global networking issue on their infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Since 11:43 UTC, we switched the DNS for some customer projects from Cloudflare to the Fastly service for <code>*.aem.live</code>.
      This fully restored authoring and publishing services. While the Cloudflare issue continued, our customers were no longer impacted.
      We will continue to monitor the situation and plan to switch back to Cloudflare once their infrastructure is confirmed stable.</p>
