    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>
        On November 18, 2025, between 11:31 UTC and 15:30 UTC, a global Cloudflare outage impacted our
        publishing services with an overall error rate of 0.61%. Our team detected the issue within
        minutes through automated monitoring and initiated failover to AWS within 11 minutes. The delivery
        service experienced minimal impact (0.07% error rate) and was fully restored by 14:40 UTC. The
        publishing service was restored by 15:30 UTC. No data loss occurred, and the vast majority of
        customers experienced either no impact or brief interruptions.

    <p>
        The root cause was a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/">global outage at Cloudflare</a>,
        lasting from 11:20 UTC to 17:06 UTC.

    <h2>Action items</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In case of a future Cloudflare outage, we always need to switch to the healthy stack at the DNS level from the beginning
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve runbook to provide clearer steps and better help us manage a global Cloudflare outage
      </li>
      <li>
        Clearly define all technical services that belong to the delivery and publishing business service SLOs
      </li>
      <li>
        Consolidate logs from all relevant technical services to help the on-call engineer with an overview during an outage, as well as facilitate the RCA
