    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        On December 2, 2025 at 6:53 UTC, an automatic dependency update was deployed to <code>admin.da.live</code> that
        caused the service to fail. Publishing content on <code>admin.da.live</code> was no longer possible, affecting
        all customers attempting to publish content from da.live. The overall da.live error rate reached 22.3% during
        the incident, with publishing requests being affected the most at 97%. The issue was detected through monitoring
        alerts after 24 minutes at 7:17 AM UTC. After a quick investigation and root cause identification, the service
        was rolled back at 7:23 AM UTC and fully restored at 07:24 UTC. The incident duration was 31 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Root Cause</h3>
    <p>
        A dependency update of <code>@aws-sdk/client-s3</code> to version <code>3.933.0</code> was automatically
        deployed to the <code>admin.da.live</code> service as part of our dependency management service and continuous
        deployment pipeline. This dependency update was incompatible with existing worker deployment infrastructure and
        resulting in a broken deployment that was not caught by our automated testing suite. This caused the admin
        service to fail when attempting to process publishing requests, resulting in a complete inability for users to
        publish content.
    </p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        At 7:17 UTC, the engineering team identified the faulty deployment and at 7:23 AM UTC initiated a rollback to
        the previous stable version of admin.da.live. The rollback completed successfully at 07:24 UTC, immediately
        restoring publishing functionality. Publishing operations that failed during the incident need to be retried manually.
    </p>

    <h3>Action Items</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement pre-production testing environment for automatic dependency updates to catch breaking changes
            before they reach production</li>
        <li>Add integration tests that specifically validate publishing workflows to prevent similar failures</li>
        <li>Establish dependency update review process requiring manual approval for critical changes</li>
        <li>Improve monitoring and alerting to detect publishing failures earlier than 20 minutes</li>
    </ul>
