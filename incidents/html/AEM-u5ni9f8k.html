  <h2>Postmortem</h2>
  <p>
    On 02.09.2025 16:24 UTC we noticed that there was a slight (<0.1%) increase in errors being served by Edge Delivery
      Services. Upon investigation, we found that the errors were limited to media requests and caused by a degradation
      of a service dependency. </p>
      <p>
        The supplier acknowledged and fixed the issue within 4 hours.
