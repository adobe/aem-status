  <h2>Postmortem</h2>
  <p>
    On 02.09.2025 16:24 UTC we noticed that there was a slight (&lt;0.1%) increase in errors being served by Edge
    Delivery
    Services. Upon investigation, we found that the errors were limited to media requests and caused by a degradation
    of a service dependency. </p>
  <p>
    The supplier acknowledged and fixed the issue within 4 hours.
