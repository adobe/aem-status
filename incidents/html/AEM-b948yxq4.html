 <h1 class="none">AEM Sidekick sign in no longer working after upgrade to Google Chrome v145.0.*</h1>

    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Around 14:30 UTC, a user whose Google Chrome had just been upgraded to the new major version 145 started noticing problems on <a href="https://tools.aem.live/" target="_blank">https://tools.aem.live</a>. When trying to sign in to a project, they would see the following alert:
       </p><blockquote><i>AEM Sidekick is required to sign in. Install now?</i></blockquote>
       There was no workaround.
    <p>
       The problem was caused by a breaking change in the Chrome API that was incompatible with the sidekick. A sidekick fix was pushed out at 15:32 UTC and published on the Chrome Web Store at 15:54 UTC.
    </p>

    <h3>Root Cause</h3>
    <p>
       Our immediate investigation releaved that Chrome version 145 indeed introduced a breaking change to their extensions' external messaging API: external message listeners can no longer be <code>async</code> and use the <code>sendResponse</code> callback simultaneously. The change had been <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/4txWvDW55hU?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">announced here</a> a while back.
    </p>
<p>
  This broke the sidekick's ability to properly respond to messages sent from <code>tools.aem.live</code>, or the admin API, blocking the ability to sign in to projects or tools that required authentication.
</p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        Making the external message listener synchronous immediately resolved the issue. A fix was released for review at 15:32 UTC and published at 15:54 UTC.
    </p>
<p>Users still experiencing issues please make sure their extensions are up to date.</p>
