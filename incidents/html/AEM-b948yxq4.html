 <h1 class="none">AEM Sidekick sign in no longer working after upgrade to Google Chrome v145.0.*</h1>
<article data-incident-start-time="2026-02-11T14:30:00.000Z" data-incident-end-time="2026-02-11T15:54:00.000Z" data-incident-error-rate="0" data-incident-impacted-service="publishing">

    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Around 14:30 UTC, a user whose Google Chrome had just been upgraded to the new major version 145 started noticing problems on <a href="https://tools.aem.live/" target="_blank">https://tools.aem.live</a>. When trying to sign in to a project, they would see the following alert:
       </p><blockquote><i>AEM Sidekick is required to sign in. Install now?</i></blockquote>
       All users running Chrome version 145 were theoretically affected without a workaround, however it is impossible for us to determine how many users ran into this issue trying to sign in to a project during the incident. Sign in was obstructed but there was no data loss.
    <p>
       The problem was caused by a breaking change in the Chrome API that was incompatible with the sidekick. A sidekick fix was pushed out at 15:32 UTC and published on the Chrome Web Store at 15:54 UTC.
    </p>

    <h3>Root Cause</h3>
    <p>
       Our immediate investigation revealed that Chrome version 145, which was released and auto-updated for users, introduced a breaking change to their extensions' external messaging API: external message listeners can no longer be <code>async</code> and use the <code>sendResponse</code> callback simultaneously. The change had been <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/4txWvDW55hU" target="_blank">already announced here</a> in November 2025.
    </p>
<p>
  This broke the sidekick's ability to properly respond to messages sent from <code>tools.aem.live</code>, or the admin API, blocking the ability to sign in to projects or tools that required authentication. Users trying to sign in would be left stranded.
</p>
<h3>Detection</h3>
<p>
    The incident was detected through a user report at 14:30 UTC, shortly after Chrome 145 began auto-updating for
    users. We do not have automated monitoring in place to detect Chrome version updates or extension communication
    failures, so we were relying on reactive rather than proactive detection.
</p>
<p>
    This delayed our ability to prepare a fix in advance of the Chrome 145 rollout, despite the API change being
    announced 4 months prior.
</p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        Making the external message listener synchronous immediately resolved the issue. A fix was released for review at 15:32 UTC and published at 15:54 UTC.
    </p>
<p>Users still experiencing issues please make sure their extensions are up to date.</p>

    <h3>What Went Well</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fast incident response: fix developed, reviewed, and published within 84 minutes of detection</li>
        <li>Root cause identified quickly through systematic investigation</li>
        <li>Clear communication to users about the issue and resolution steps</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What Could Have Gone Better</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>AEM Sidekick was using an anti-pattern that Chrome had flagged for deprecation</li>
        <li>The Chrome API change was announced 4 months in advance, but we did not have processes to track and act on it</li>
        <li>No automated testing against Chrome beta/canary versions to catch compatibility issues before production release</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Action Items</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscribe to the <code>chromium-extensions</code> Google Group to get notified early about upcoming breaking changes and anticipate crucial release dates</li>
        <li>Explore adding a CI test using Chrome beta/canary versions to detect incompatibilities before new sidekick versions get published.</li>
    </ul>
