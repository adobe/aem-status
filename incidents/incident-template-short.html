    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>
        [Describe when the incident was noticed, what the observable problem was, and what
        services or features were affected. Use UTC timestamps and be specific about the impact.]
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: On September 11, 2024 at 12:30 UTC, we noticed that the AEM Code Sync Github
        application had stopped dispatching github events since 05:00 UTC. As a result, github
        actions triggered by repository_dispatch events were no longer invoked.
    </p>

    <h3>Root Cause</h3>
    <p>
        [Explain the underlying technical reason for the incident. What failed or changed?]
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: A content-write permission on the AEM Code Sync Github application was removed,
        which is required to dispatch events. This permission change prevented the application
        from notifying repositories of content updates.
    </p>

    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>
        [Describe how the issue was fixed and any actions customers need to take.]
    </p>
    <p>
        Example: The missing permission was restored, and event dispatching resumed immediately.
        Customers using repository_dispatch events in their github actions need to approve the
        altered permissions. Organization admins should have received an email from GitHub.
    </p>

    <h3>Action Items</h3>
    <p>
        [List 2-5 specific actions to prevent recurrence. Include monitoring, process, or
        technical improvements with owners if known.]
