    <h2>Postmortem</h2>
    <p>
        On 11.09.2024 12:30 UTC we noticed that the AEM Code Sync Github application has 
        stopped dispatching github events since 05:00 UTC. As a result, github actions that 
        are triggered on a repository_dispatch event were not longer invoked. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason was a removed content-write permission of the AEM Code Sync Github 
        application which is required to dispatch events. After restoring the permission, 
        the notifications were dispatched again.

        <p>
            The relevant permission needed for the github events have been updated and the notifications are dispatched again. 
            Customers that use repository_dispatch events in their github actions need to approve the altered permissions. 
            The organization admins should have received an email from github.
